About 80% of the students had lectures in human psychology and developmental disorders as well as practical training in AAI (88.3%) and practical dog training (87%).</p>
                                <p>The length of the courses varies from 14 hours to 750 hours, the most popular are 200-hours courses (13.4%), 300-hours and 120-hours (7.5% each) 100-hours (6%) and 360-hours (4.5 hours).  90.9% of people had to pass exams after the course, of which 81.8% passed also a practical exam (with their dogs).</p>

                                <p>As we can see in the results, the education of dogs and handlers in Poland is very differential and there is no common standard. There are many organizations and companies provided courses, and the length of them is 14-750 hours. Some of them are only theoretical, without any dog training or practical exam. This survey has shown that we need some guidelines and good practices to unify and improve the quality of human-dog teams training. The field of AAI is very embroiled and it is not possible to give the clear summary of training, examination and conducting AAI.</p>
